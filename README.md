Slightly customized us and ru layouts for squeekboard for use with Poco X3 Pro (vayu) on 300% scaling.

It's a little wider than original, so it extends to the edges of the screen and also have `comma` key on the default view, so you don't need to switch to numbers to type it.

Put the yaml file into `~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards` and it will work immediately
